## Proposal

### Target Audience:

We are looking to serve a similar audience to sites such as [cardgames.io](https://cardgames.io/), which are people who like to play simple games on the fly.

### What We Plan to Accomplish:

We plan on making a web application that conists of various games.  The application itself will have a landing page that welcomes the user and contains interactive elements that allow the user to select the game they want to play and be routed to a different endpoint containing the game in question. 

The games in question will be:

1. Duda: A latin american dice game involving 2-6 players. This implementation will be using the rules provided [here](https://bead.game/games/dice-games/dudo). The page will allow the user to select the number of opponents (from 2-6) that they wish to play against. Then the game will proceed until the user has won, or has been eliminated from the game. They will then have the option to start a new game.

2. Squish-The-Cockroach: This game is for anyone who enjoys the calming feel of tap-and-click interactions. In a quick 30-second round, squish as many cockroaches as you canâ€”each squish earns a credit. Log in at the end to save your score. Simple by design, it taps into ***self-regulation through sensory input***: repetitive, small actions that can help ease stress, anxiety, and boredom.


3. 1000 Clicks in 10 minutes: The user is challenged to get 1,000 points within a timeframe of 10 minutes. To gain a point, the user can simply click on a button and it will add a point. However, the user can also trade points to gain powerups which could help them get points in a quicker timeframe. While the user will have 10 minutes to complete the challenge, it's best they complete it as fast as possible
