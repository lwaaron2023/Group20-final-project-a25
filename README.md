# Battleship

## General

This project represents the game of battleship in which two opponents must place their ships,
then try and guess where the other person's ships are. The game uses the same rules as battleship.
The controls are:

To interact with tiles/select ships/place ships: left-click
To rotate a ship before placement: press r with a ship selected

To select a ship to place simply click on one of the boxes with the letter "0" in it, and the number of "0"s will dictate the length of the ship.

## Runtime instructions

Simply run the following command when in the serverSide folder:

```powershell
node server.js
```
