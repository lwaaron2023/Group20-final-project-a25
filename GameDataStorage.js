Log in at the end to save your score. Simple by design, it taps into self-regulation through sensory input: repetitive, small actions that can help ease stress, anxiety, and boredom."

The AI opponent will give answers that may be true or bluff, based on its personality (Honest, Sneaky, or Chaotic). Players will see the question, the AI’s answer, their current score and round, and buttons to Trust or Call Bluff, along with power-ups like Fact Check and Double Down. Points are earned or lost based on correct decisions, and a final score is displayed at the end, creating an interactive challenge of knowledge and intuition."
